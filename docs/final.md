## Project Summary
For our project we set out with the goal to create an AI that would protect an entity in MineCraft. We saw a problem in MineCraft that if you were not in Creative Mode you could be attacked by other creates, what we wanted to do was create an AI that would protect an entity for other creatures.
This idea was put into practice by us creating an AI through Malmo that would allow us to protect a Villager from a Zombie that wanted to attack it, thus we created QProtector.
The setup of QProtector is us putting an ususpecting Villager into an arena with a Zombie that wants to kill it. Our agent is also spawned inside the region and given the task of keeping the Villager safe and dispatching the Zombie.


## Approaches


## Evaluation


## References
For an example of Function Approximation using Stochastic Gradient Descent we used the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/FA/Q-Learning%20with%20Value%20Function%20Approximation%20Solution.ipynb).
It was quite helpful and shows how to use a built in model provided by sci-kit learn on an open AI dataset.

The ever loving [MineCraft Guide](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands) was always helpful for showing us which commands to run through the Minecraft prompt and assisted us in setting the behaviors of the entities.

A large portion of our project and the core concept of Reinforcement Learning was learned and gleaned from Sutton's textbook on the subject with a free online version [here](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-1st.html).

And we would like to give a huge thanks to both Professor Singh and our great TA Moshe for assisting us with all of our questions throughout this quarter.
