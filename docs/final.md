## Project Summary


## Approaches


## Evaluation


## References
For an example of Function Approximation using Stochastic Gradient Descent we used the following [Github Repo](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/FA/Q-Learning%20with%20Value%20Function%20Approximation%20Solution.ipynb).
It was quite helpful and shows how to use a built in model provided by sci-kit learn on an open AI dataset.

The ever loving [MineCraft Guide](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands) was always helpful for showing us which commands to run through the Minecraft prompt and assisted us in setting the behaviors of the entities.

A large portion of our project and the core concept of Reinforcement Learning was learned and gleaned from Sutton's textbook on the subject with a free online version [here](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book-1st.html).

And we would like to give a huge thanks to both Professor Singh and our great TA Moshe for assisting us with all of our questions throughout this quarter.
