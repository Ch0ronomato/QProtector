# Project Summary
The purpose of our AI is to act as a body guard for a specific target. The target may be a user, character, or structure. Our scenario consists of having a villager NPC guarded by our AI from zombies. The AI will be trained through reinforcement learning, being awarded positively for the duration it is able to keep the target alive and negatively when the target perishes. The eventual goal is to be able to have the AI act as a sentry and guard a point of interest for a user, allowing said user to tend to other matters.
