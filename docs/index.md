# Welcome to QProtector team page.

**QProtector** is an AI for Minecraft that was built using the [Microsoft Malmo platform](https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo). The intended use of this AI is to be given an entity to protect and protect it.
This has been built by Ian Schweer, Travis Chiang, and Allen Sallinger from UCI for their project in AI course, CS175, under the teaching of Professor Sameer Singh.

The current implementation of the AI along with all source code can be found on [github](https://github.com/IanSchweer/QProtector). It is currently implemented using Reinforcement Learning, specifically Q-Learning using SARSA. We are using function approximation through a Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor at this time instead of
the Q-Table that we were originally using enable for faster training.
